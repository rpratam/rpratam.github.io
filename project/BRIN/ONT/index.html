        <h1>What is DNA Assembly?</h1>
        <div class="section" id="intro-assembly">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>DNA assembly in short is the act to build a complete picture of longer DNA sequence (chromosome, genome) from thousand to million 
                pieces of reads. In general, <u>strategy for DNA assembly</u> is either reference-guided assembly or de novo assembly. 
            
            <h3>Reference-guided Assembly</h3>
            <p>This strategy utilize reference sequence as template to assemble DNA fragments. Prior knowledge of target DNA must been known before assembly process. 
            This strategy use less computation resources, fast, and able to achieve high contiguous assembly.</p>
            <p>However, reference-guided assembly is not without its disadvantages. For starters, structural variations cannot be detected, as assembled sequence will be biased toward reference DNA structure.
            Due to bias toward reference, more diverged regions may not be reconstructed and missing, lead to reduced diversity in the target assembly.</p>
            
            <h3>De Novo Assembly</h3>
            <p>De novo means no prior knowledge being used in the assembly process. No reference being used in this assembly, reads are being stitched from scratch.
            De novo assembly are superior that reference-guided assembly in term discovering structure variants within the target genome.</p>
            <p>De novo assembly have its disadvantages compared to reference-guided assembly, which is more heavy in assembly computation. More computing resources are needed for de novo assembly, make it 
            hard to perform assembly on complex genome such as eukaryotes.</p>

        <p>For this training we will use data from Dhar et al. (2019) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz038">https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz038</a></p>
        <p>The authors performed whole genome sequencing on Blue Indian Peacock using ONT and Illumina. In this training we will use only Illumina reads. This reads was generated from MinION devices

        <h1>Quality Control (QC)</h1>
        <div class="section" id="quality-check">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Quality Control (QC) is a crucial step in DNA sequencing to ensure that the data generated is accurate and reliable. </p>
            <p>The sequencing technologies usually produce basecalls with varying quality. In addition, there could be sample-specific issues in your sequencing run, such as adapter contamination. It is standard procedure to check the quality of the reads and identify problems before doing further analysis. 
           Checking the quality and making some decisions for the downstream analysis can influence the outcome of your project. This is very important for long-read sequences like ONT. </p>
            <p>Nanopore sequencing is known for its relatively high error rates, particularly in homopolymeric regions (stretches of the same nucleotide). The error rate can range from 5% to 15%, although recent advancements have improved this somewhat. 
            The accuracy of base calling in nanopore sequencing can be compromised due to the complex process of interpreting changes in electrical current as DNA passes through the nanopore. While improvements in algorithms and technology are ongoing, base calling remains less accurate than Illumina.</p>

            </ul>    
            
            <h4>Quality check with NanoPlot</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In the search box of tools (upper left), type <strong>NanoPlot</strong>, then click on the search result "<strong>NanoPlot</strong>: Plotting suite for Oxford....."</li>
                <li>on the middle workspace, NanoPlot parameter will be displayed. Make sure you select the uploaded fastq file in the "<strong>files</strong>" option</li>

        <h1>Assembly de Novo with Flye</h1>
        <div class="section" id="assembly">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Flye is using a repeat graph as the core data structure. Compared to de Bruijn graphs (which require exact k-mer matches), repeat graphs are built using approximate sequence matches, and can tolerate the higher noise of SMS reads.
                The edges of a repeat graph represent the genomic sequence, and nodes define the junctions. Each edge is classified as unique or repetitive. The genome traverses the graph (in an unknown way), so each unique edge appears exactly once in this traversal. 
                Repeat graphs reveal the repeat structure of the genome, which helps to reconstruct an optimal assembly.</p>
