        <h1>What is DNA Assembly?</h1>
        <div class="section" id="intro-assembly">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>DNA assembly in short is the act to build a complete picture of longer DNA sequence (chromosome, genome) from thousand to million 
                pieces of reads. In general, <u>strategy for DNA assembly</u> is either reference-guided assembly or de novo assembly. 
            
            <h3>Reference-guided Assembly</h3>
            <p>This strategy utilize reference sequence as template to assemble DNA fragments. Prior knowledge of target DNA must been known before assembly process. 
            This strategy use less computation resources, fast, and able to achieve high contiguous assembly.</p>
            <p>However, reference-guided assembly is not without its disadvantages. For starters, structural variations cannot be detected, as assembled sequence will be biased toward reference DNA structure.
            Due to bias toward reference, more diverged regions may not be reconstructed and missing, lead to reduced diversity in the target assembly.</p>
            
            <h3>De Novo Assembly</h3>
            <p>De novo means no prior knowledge being used in the assembly process. No reference being used in this assembly, reads are being stitched from scratch.
            De novo assembly are superior that reference-guided assembly in term discovering structure variants within the target genome.</p>
            <p>De novo assembly have its disadvantages compared to reference-guided assembly, which is more heavy in assembly computation. More computing resources are needed for de novo assembly, make it 
            hard to perform assembly on complex genome such as eukaryotes.</p>

        <h1>Quality Control (QC)</h1>
        <div class="section" id="quality-check">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Quality Control (QC) is a crucial step in DNA sequencing to ensure that the data generated is accurate and reliable. </p>
            <p>The sequencing technologies usually produce basecalls with varying quality. In addition, there could be sample-specific issues in your sequencing run, such as adapter contamination. It is standard procedure to check the quality of the reads and identify problems before doing further analysis. 
           Checking the quality and making some decisions for the downstream analysis can influence the outcome of your project. This is very important for long-read sequences like ONT. </p>
            <p>Nanopore sequencing is known for its relatively high error rates, particularly in homopolymeric regions (stretches of the same nucleotide). The error rate can range from 5% to 15%, although recent advancements have improved this somewhat. 
            The accuracy of base calling in nanopore sequencing can be compromised due to the complex process of interpreting changes in electrical current as DNA passes through the nanopore. While improvements in algorithms and technology are ongoing, base calling remains less accurate than Illumina.</p>

        <h1>Assembly de Novo</h1>
        <div class="section" id="assembly">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>De novo assembly is the process of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from short sequencing reads without the use of a reference genome. This method is particularly useful for sequencing genomes of organisms for which no reference genome is available.</p>
            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Read Overlap:</strong> Identifying overlaps between sequencing reads to assemble them into longer contiguous sequences (contigs).</li>
                <li><strong>Contig Construction:</strong> Merging overlapping reads into contigs, which represent contiguous DNA sequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> Ordering and orienting contigs using paired-end reads or mate-pair reads to form scaffolds.</li>
                <li><strong>Gap Filling:</strong> Closing gaps between contigs within scaffolds to produce a more complete assembly.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Polishing</h1>
        <div class="section" id="polishing">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Polishing is the process of refining the assembled genome to correct errors and improve accuracy. This step is essential to ensure that the final assembly is of high quality and accurately represents the original DNA sequence.</p>
            <h3>Polishing Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Error Correction:</strong> Use algorithms to identify and correct sequencing errors such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Read Alignment:</strong> Align raw sequencing reads back to the assembled genome to identify discrepancies and make corrections.</li>
                <li><strong>Consensus Building:</strong> Generate a consensus sequence that represents the most likely sequence based on the aligned reads.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Use independent sequencing technologies or additional data to validate the accuracy of the polished assembly.</li>
